= Puppet-Maven

A Puppet recipe for Apache Maven, to download artifacts from a Maven repository

Uses {Apache Maven}[http://maven.apache.org] command line to download the artifacts.


= Usage

  maven { "/tmp/myfile":
    id => "groupId:artifactId:version:packaging:classifier",
    repos => ["id::layout::http://repo.acme.com","http://repo2.acme.com"],
  }

or

  maven { "/tmp/myfile":
    groupid => "org.apache.maven",
    artifactid => "maven-core",
    version => "2.2.1",
    packaging => "jar",
    classifier => "sources",
    repos => ["id::layout::http://repo.acme.com","http://repo2.acme.com"],
  }


= Examples

== Setup

  $repo1 = {
    id => "myrepo",
    username => "myuser",
    password => "mypassword",
    url => "http://repo.acme.com",
    mirrorof => "external:*",      # if you want to use the repo as a mirror, see maven::settings below
  }

  # Install Maven
  class { "maven::maven":
    version => "2.2.1", # version to install
    # you can get Maven tarball from a Maven repository instead than from Apache servers, optionally with a user/password
    repo => {
      #url => "http://repo1.maven.org/maven2",
      #username => "",
      #password => "",
    },
    user                 => "root",  # if you want to run it as a different user (defaults to root), will create it if not defined
    home                 => "/root", # home directory of the user
    user_system          => true,    # make the user a system user
    maven_opts           => "",      # anything to add to MAVEN_OPTS in ~/.mavenrc
    maven_path_additions => "",      # anything to add to the PATH in ~/.mavenrc
  } ->

  # Create a settings.xml with the repo credentials
  class { "maven::settings" :
    mirrors => [$repo1], # mirrors entry in settings.xml, uses id, url, mirrorof from the hash passed
    servers => [$repo1], # servers entry in settings.xml, uses id, username, password from the hash passed
  }

  # defaults for all maven{} declarations
  Maven {
    user  => "maven", # you can make puppet run Maven as a specific user instead of root, useful to share Maven settings and local repository
    group => "maven", # you can make puppet run Maven as a specific group
    repos => "http://repo1.maven.apache.org/maven2"
  }

== Downloading artifacts

  maven { "/tmp/maven-core-2.2.1.jar":
    id => "org.apache.maven:maven-core:2.2.1:jar",
    repos => ["central::default::http://repo1.maven.apache.org/maven2","http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven2"],
  }

  maven { "/tmp/maven-core-2.2.1-sources.jar":
    groupid    => "org.apache.maven",
    artifactid => "maven-core",
    version    => "2.2.1",
    classifier => "sources",
  }

= Buildr version

Initially there was an {Apache Buildr}[http://buildr.apache.org] version, but it required to have Buildr installed before running Puppet

And you would need to {enable pluginsync}[http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/plugins_in_modules.html#enabling-pluginsync]
in both master and clients
